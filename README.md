Music is in a way a universal language, irrespective of your origin; wherever you come from, you can
always connect through music. The essence of music lies in the fact that being universal, it is diverse in
nature. Indian Classical Music is a part of this diversity and is infinitely vast within itself. For an
enthusiastic amateur to learn, grasp and understand Indian Classical Music(ICM) is not easy and
accessible. And thus we aim to act as a catalyst in this process. Everyone has his/her way of
experimenting with music, which brings uniqueness to it. Our project focuses on developing an application
that will provide a platform for the music enthusiasts to learn all the basics about Hindustani Classical
Music (HCM) and perfect it. Along with that, encouraging their experimental space by providing a
generation platform to create their own melodies for specific ragas.
