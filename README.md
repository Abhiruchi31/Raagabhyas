Music is in a way a universal language, irrespective of your origin; wherever you come from, you
can always connect through music. The essence of music lies in the fact that being universal,it
is diverse. Indian Classical Music is a part of this diversity and is infinitely vast on its own.
For an enthusiastic amateur to learn, grasp and understand Indian Classical Music(ICM) is not
easy and we aim to act as a catalyst in this process. Everyone has his/her way of experimenting
while playing or singing which brings uniqueness to it. Our project focuses on developing an
application that will provide a platform to learn all the basics about Hindustani Classical Music
(HCM) and perfect it. Also to encourage experimental space, the application will generate music
based on user input notes.
